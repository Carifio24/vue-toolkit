<h1>Cosmic Data Stories Vue Toolkit</h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

As the name suggests, the Vue Toolkit is built using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, an open-source JavaScript framework. The toolkit leverages the power and versatility of Vue to create a number of flexible components, together with some utility functions to make common operations easier. Before you can get started building, though, you'll (possibly) need to install a few things.

<h4>Node.js</h4>

The first thing that you'll need to use the toolkit is <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a>, an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. To get started, simply download Node.js from the linked page and install it on your computer.

<h4>Yarn</h4>

Technically, this one is optional - you can write Vue-based applications using Node's built-in package manager [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager) without any issue. However, we on the CosmicDS team use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for our package management, and that's what we'll use in our examples on this webpage. Yarn uses the same [registry of packages](https://www.npmjs.com/) as npm, so everything you find on NPM is fair game. (If you want to use NPM, that's fine - you just may need to translate some commands here and there).

<h4>Install the toolkit</h4>

Once you have Node.js and your package manager of choice set up, you can install the toolkit by simply running
<pre>yarn add @cosmicds/vue-toolkit</pre>
