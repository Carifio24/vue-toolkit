<h1>Cosmic Data Stories Vue Toolkit</h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>As the name suggests, the Vue Toolkit is built using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, an open-source JavaScript framework. The toolkit leverages the power and versatility of Vue to create a number of flexible components, together with some utility functions to make common operations easier. Before you can get started building, though, you'll (possibly) need to install a few things.</p>

<h4>Node.js</h4>

<p>The first thing that you'll need to use the toolkit is <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a>, an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. To get started, simply download Node.js from the linked page and install it on your computer.</p>

<h4>Yarn</h4>

<p>Technically, this one is optional - you can write Vue-based applications using Node's built-in package manager <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager">NPM</a> without any issue. However, we on the CosmicDS team use <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</a> for our package management, and that's what we'll use in our examples on this webpage. Yarn uses the same <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">registry of packages</a> as npm, so everything you find on NPM is fair game. (If you want to use NPM, that's fine - you just may need to translate some commands here and there).</p>

<h4>Install the toolkit</h4>

<p>Once you have Node.js and a Vue project set up, you can install the toolkit by simply running</p>
<pre>yarn add @cosmicds/vue-toolkit</pre>
<p>If the part about setting up a Vue project is totally new to you, don't worry! You can follow our guide for <a href="">creating a story</a> - we'll help your story get up and running in no time.</p>
