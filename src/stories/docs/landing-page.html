<h1>Cosmic Data Stories Vue Toolkit</h1>

<h2>What Is It?</h2>

<p>The Cosmic Data Stories Vue Toolkit is a package of versatile, flexible components designed to help simplify the process of making educational web-based interactives. The the name suggests, this toolkit is built using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, an open-source JavaScript framework. The toolkit leverages the power and versatility of Vue to create a number of reusable components that can be used in a variety of data stories. The toolkit also includes some utility functions to help make common operations easier.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with the Toolkit</h2>

<p>While we've aimed to make the toolkit as simple to use as possible, there are a few things that you'll need to install, if you don't have them already. (Note that users of your interactives won't need to do any of this - this step is necessary for developers only).</p>

<p>The first thing that you'll need to use the toolkit is <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a>, an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. To get started, simply download Node.js from the linked page and install it on your computer.</p>

<p>Technically, this one is optional - you can write Vue-based applications using Node's built-in package manager <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager">NPM</a> without any issue. However, we on the CosmicDS team use <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</a> for our package management, and that's what we'll use in our examples on this webpage. Yarn uses the same <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">registry of packages</a> as npm, so everything you find on NPM is fair game. (If you want to use NPM, that's fine - you just may need to translate some commands here and there).</p>

<h4>Set up a Vue project</h4>

<p>Once you have the necessary tools installed, you'll want to set up a Vue project to start building your story with the toolkit.</p>

<h4>Install the toolkit</h4>

<p>Once you have Node.js and a Vue project set up, you can install the toolkit by simply running</p>
<pre>yarn add @cosmicds/vue-toolkit</pre>
